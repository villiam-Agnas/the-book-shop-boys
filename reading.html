                <h2>Fahrenheit 451</h2>
                <p>Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel set in a future where books are banned and firemen burn them to suppress independent thought. The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman who begins to question his role and the empty, controlled world around him. Encounters with people who value curiosity and knowledge awaken his doubts, pushing him toward a dangerous search for meaning. The novel explores themes of censorship, conformity, and the power of ideas, showing how a society built on distraction and fear loses its humanity. It is both a gripping tale and a timeless warning about the cost of silence.</p>

                <h2>Current Thoughts</h2>
                <p>I have only gotten about halv way through the book so my opinion is bound to change, but currently i find it a bit hard to get sucked in to the book so to speak. The writing can at times be in my opinion a bit complicated and the plot development has been a bit slow. It feels like the pace is picking up tho so i am still hopefull.</p>
